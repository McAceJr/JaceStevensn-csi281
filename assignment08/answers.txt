1. What is faster to find an answer given the same graph, same start node, and same goal node: breadth-first search, depth-first search, or "it depends"? Explain why.
Most of the time BFS but if the goal is really far from the start down 1 path then DFS has a slightly faster time.

2. What is the worst case (Big-O) runtime of breadth-first search? Explain why.
It's normally notated as O(V+E) v is the number of vertexes and e is the number of edges.

3. Why would an adjacency matrix be less memory efficient than an adjacency list for storing a social graph of friends, like part of Facebook?
an adjacency list has an easier time adding and removing connections between friends.

4. Give an example of depth-first search in the real world (not on a computer).
